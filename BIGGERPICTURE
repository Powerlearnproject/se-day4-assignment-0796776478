1. Create a New Repository on GitHub
Go to GitHub and sign in to your account.
Click the "+" icon in the upper-right corner and select "New repository."
Enter a repository name (e.g., se-day4-assignment-0796776478).
Optionally, add a description, choose visibility (public or private), and initialize with a README (optional, since you'll be doing this from the command line).
Click "Create repository."
2. Set Up the Local Repository
Open your terminal or command line interface and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then, execute the following commands:

Create and Initialize the Local Repository
Initialize a new Git repository:

bash
Copy code
git init
Create a README file:

bash
Copy code
echo "# se-day4-assignment-0796776478" > README.md
Create a LICENSE file:

bash
Copy code
touch LICENSE
You can add a license later depending on your choice of license. Common licenses include MIT, GPL, Apache, etc. You can use online tools or templates for adding license information.

Create a .gitignore file:

bash
Copy code
touch .gitignore
Add patterns for files and directories you want to ignore in this file. For example:

bash
Copy code
*.log
*.tmp
node_modules/
.env
Stage the files for commit:

bash
Copy code
git add README.md LICENSE .gitignore
Commit the files:

bash
Copy code
git commit -m "Initial commit with README, LICENSE, and .gitignore"
Rename the default branch to main:

bash
Copy code
git branch -M main
Add the remote repository:

bash
Copy code
git remote add origin https://github.com/Powerlearnproject/se-day4-assignment-0796776478.git
Push the commits to GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git push -u origin main
